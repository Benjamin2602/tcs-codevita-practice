Problem Description:

You are given N number of coordinates and you have to create a polygon from these points such that they will make a polygon with maximum area.

Note: coordinates provided in the input may or may not be in sequential form.

Constraints
1 <= N <= 10

Input:

First line contains an integer N which depicts number of co-ordinates

Next N lines consist of two space separated integer depicting coordinates of in form of xy

Output:
Print the maximum possible area possible by creating a polygon by joining the coordinates. 

If the area is in decimal form, print the absolute value as output.

Time Limit (secs):
1

Examples:
Input:

4

0  0

2  0

0  2

2  2

Output:

4

Explanation:

As we can imagine that these points will make a square shape and the maximum possible area made by the polygon will be 4.
